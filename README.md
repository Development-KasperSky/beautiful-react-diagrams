## 💡 Why?

Javascript diagramming libraries are often quite difficult to integrate in React projects, given the different natures of the involved libraries. 
For example a React component's lifecylce may be quite hard to keep in in sync with a MVC diagramming library.
For this reason we created `beautiful-react-diagrams` an easy-to-customise functional diagramming library built with React.

## 🎓 Principles

- **Controlled components**: exports [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) components only.
- **Renderers**: the majority of the exported components accept a `renderer` (a prop) to easily customise or extend their behaviour.
- **Lightweights**: import nothing but lightweight javascript components.

## ☕️ Features

* Concise API
* Small and lightweight
* Easy to use
* Easy to customise
