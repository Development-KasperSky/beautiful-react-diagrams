## ðŸ’¡ Why?

Javascript diagramming libraries are often difficult to integrate in React projects. <br />
Different patterns not always fit the React nature and having a component's state in in sync with an external
diagramming library might be quite difficult especially when the latter had been built in a different paradigm (such as MVC, for example).

For this reason we created `beautiful-react-diagrams` an easy-to-customise functional diagramming library to build 
diagrams with ease.

<hr />

## ðŸ’¢ Easy to customise

We developed `beautiful-react-diagrams` having in mind that each diagram is different from the other, so we tried to sum
up our experience in React components customisation introducing a number of `renderers` and a css built with `css vars`.

# Controlled

`Diagram` is a controlled component that emit a diagram schema trough an `onChange` function...

# Functional
