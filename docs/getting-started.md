Just install it.

Using `npm`:
```bash
$ npm i --save beautiful-react-diagrams
```

Using `yarn`:
```bash 
$ yarn add beautiful-react-diagrams
```

That's it. Seriously. 

Start using the `Diagram` component by importing it from `beautiful-react-diagrams`:

```js static 
import Diagram from 'beautiful-react-diagrams';
```
